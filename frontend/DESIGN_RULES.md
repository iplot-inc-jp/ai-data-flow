# Frontend Design Rules

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## What to AVOID

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

## Design Philosophy

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## DataFlow App Design Direction

### Concept: "Technical Blueprint"
A sophisticated, engineering-focused aesthetic inspired by architectural blueprints, CAD software, and precision instruments. Dark theme with cyan/teal accents on deep slate backgrounds.

### Typography
- **Display**: "JetBrains Mono" or "IBM Plex Mono" for headings (technical, precise)
- **Body**: "IBM Plex Sans" for readable content
- **Accent**: Monospace for data labels and technical info

### Color Palette
```css
:root {
  /* Base */
  --bg-primary: #0a0f1a;
  --bg-secondary: #111827;
  --bg-tertiary: #1e293b;
  
  /* Text */
  --text-primary: #f1f5f9;
  --text-secondary: #94a3b8;
  --text-muted: #64748b;
  
  /* Accent */
  --accent-primary: #06b6d4;    /* Cyan */
  --accent-secondary: #22d3ee;
  --accent-glow: rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.3);
  
  /* Semantic */
  --success: #10b981;
  --warning: #f59e0b;
  --error: #ef4444;
  --info: #3b82f6;
  
  /* Grid/Blueprint */
  --grid-line: rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.1);
  --grid-dot: rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.2);
}
```

### Visual Elements
- Subtle grid pattern backgrounds (blueprint aesthetic)
- Thin cyan accent borders
- Glowing hover states
- Technical icons with precise line weights
- Card elevations with subtle cyan glow
- Monospace labels for technical data
